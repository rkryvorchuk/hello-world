# hello-world
My first repository
I am a Business Analyst with 1 year experience of analysis in a software development company. 
I have a hands-on experience of using Jira & Confluence, gathering requirements, planning sprints and controlling the development process.
Having a Master's degree in English and German languages helps me freely communicate with foreign customers and development teams.
I am willing to grow and get new experience and knowledge
